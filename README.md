This project is about Controlling VLC mediaplayer using hand gestures
In this project,hand gesture images are collected and we will train the machine to classify the types of gesture. 
This project contains different types of gesture like ThumbsUp, Thumbsdown, Ok, Rock which means by using this gestures vlc mediaplayer will control volume increase,volume decrease,play and pause. 
We trained the machine to achieve the accuracy and get the possible outcome.
In addition to that we  can give more gestures and  action this project focuses on only four gestures
